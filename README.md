## About the Project

Approximately 1 in 5 women and 1 in 71 men will experience sexual assault or rape in their lifetime according to a 2010 study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control.  During that same year, 65,000 individuals were reported missing and in danger indicating they were likely kidnapped.  Even more disturbing, these assaults are most often committed in public spaces at night when the victim is alone and most vulnerable.   Awareness of your surroundings is, of course, one of if not the most important factor in avoiding becoming a victim, but you can't always be so vigilant.  This raises the question: who will watch your back when there is no one else there to?

### Introducing iWatchYourBack: an intelligent wearable proximity alarm

## How It Works
* Version 1.0 of iWatchYourBack features a sonar and camera that attach to your backpack.  These devices integrate with our app to first identify potential threats using a human detection OpenCV script interfacing with the camera then approximate their distance using the sonar.  
* When a potential threat is sensed within a specified distance, your phone and smart watch will continuosly vibrate to warn the user of this potential threat.  This sets the proximity alarm to the "ready" position in which abnormal agitiation of the accelerometer in any device integrated with app including the phone itself will trigger the alarm.  * * When the alarm is triggered, a noise is played through the speakers at the phone's highest audio level, GPS location is pinned and set to actively track, and the authorities are notified.  
* To mitigate false alarms, there is a small window when the alarm is triggered where the user can deactivate it by using both facial recognition and inputting a PIN number.
